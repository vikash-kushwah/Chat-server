Run Vite with Host Flag:

Instead of editing the config, you can simply start Vite with the --host flag:
npm run dev -- --host
This automatically binds Vite to all network interfaces, making your app accessible on other devices.
and provide the network links

we can also run directly as:
npm run dev
But this will require local ipv4 address with port number to access it
